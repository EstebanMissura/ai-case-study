## Overview and Origin
* Name of company
#### Meta Platforms (project by Meta AI in collaboration with Ray-Ban)
* When was the company incorporated?
#### Meta Platforms was incorporated in 2015 (previously known as Facebook Inc., which started in 2004), while Ray-Bay was incorporated in 1936.
* Who are the founders of the company?
#### Meta Platforms was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, while Ray-Ban was founded by Bausch & Lomb and was later sold to Luxottica Group in 1999.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
#### This collaboration and project (Ray-Ban Stories – smart AI sunglasses) emerged from the idea of incorporating high-tech with everyday functionality in the fashion world. Meta AI in partnership with Ray-Ban, wanted to be leaders in this space, and provide a new and innovative experience for customers in the daily use, lifestyle, and accessories industry. It also allows these companies to expand their data collection capabilities and market research. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
#### Facebook initially received $500,000 in external funding in 2004. After that and throughout the years, Meta has raised $24.6 million from 14 funding rounds, and the company went public in 2012 which helped them increase their funding capabilities (Big 3 Films, 2021). Furthermore, this project is done in collaboration with Ray-Ban, which has a considerable amount of funding through their operations revenue. According to their letter to shareholders, their revenue has “soared to an unprecedented $8.7 billion, marking a remarkable 23% growth”  this year (Ray-Ban, 2024). In other words, both companies are whales in their fields that have enough funding to take on the expensive task of merging the artificial intelligence world with the lifestyle and accessories world.

## Business Activities
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
#### This project goes beyond just trying to create the first advanced smart eyewear, as it is one of the first instances where technology and fashion merge to provide innovative experiences to a customer’s lifestyle. Meta AI and Ray-Ban are trying to build the bridge between high-tech artificial intelligence and usable accessories/fashion that provide enhanced and smart experiences. 
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
#### Meta Platforms’ intended customer is literally everyone on the planet who has access to a smart device (smartphone, laptop, etc.). With their most known products, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta AI, they want to be in everybody’s pocket and provide accessible and smart solutions to social media interaction and technology. Meta currently has 3.19 billion people using at least one of their products (Social Shepard, 2024), meaning an immense pool of people will know about this project. The intended customer is primarily tech-savvy people who are eager to integrate daily use fashion with cutting edge AI technology. This type of consumer is also interested in high end luxurious products and cares about style, brand, and reputation, given that Ray-Ban is considered a luxury high-end company. Ray-Ban’s biggest audience are 25–34-year-olds, making this product very attractive to the younger working-class demographic. If we combine both pools of Meta and Ray-Ban users, the market size for this project is considerably large, somewhere in the millions of users worldwide.
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
#### The Ray-Ban Stories (Meta AI Ray-Ban sunglasses) provide the perfect intersection of smart tech and luxury branded accessories. They offer a wide range of AI capabilities apart from the desired luxurious look of Ray-Ban sunglasses. The unfair advantage they utilize is their actual partnership. They have one of the most powerful technology companies (and leaders in the AI space with Meta) and arguably the most well-known sunglasses brand in the world (Ray-Ban). They target both types of customers, those looking for innovative techy solutions and those who want good-looking accessories. Competitors, such as Bose and Google cannot offer this (Chat GPT).
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
#### The technology behind this project is extensive and amazing. The voice activation and interaction works by simply saying “Hey Meta”. This launches the AI assistant which offers a hands-free experience of taking pictures or videos, making calls and even live streaming social platforms like Instagram or Facebook. The advanced audio and camera integration capabilities work through a five-microphone array and speakers. It offers quality audio input and output for clear sounds and words. It also includes a 12 MP camera which allows for the highest definition and quality for photos and videos. The smart assistant can provide real time information about almost any topic, it can help with navigation, and it is basically the most augmented hands-free assistance experience (Chat GPT). Meta AI will also launch Llama 3 in the near future, which will power the newer version of the sunglasses. The technology is said to be just as powerful or even more so than OpenAI’s GPT (Tom’s Guide, 2024). Finally, it’s also noteworthy to mention that you can turn them on and off, which allows customers to have control over the AI and the information it absorbs.

## Landscape
* What field is the company in?
#### Meta Platforms is in the social networking/advertising/business insight solutions fields and Meta AI is specifically their artificial intelligence laboratory. Ray-Ban, on the other hand, is in the daily use, luxury lifestyle, and accessories field.
* What have been the major trends and innovations in this field over the last 5 to 10 years?
#### The entire AI field has taken an incredible growth leap in the last 5-10 years. Topics such as deep learning/neural networks, autonomous vehicles, AI ethics and Generative AI among others have grown so much, that we now have incredibly accurate data analysis models, self-driving cars, and even automatic image and data generation through language and speech. In terms of smart sunglasses specifically, this project alongside a few others are the first to combine smart tech capabilities with glass/sunglass frames, and the wearable fashion/accessories industry as a whole. Topics such as augmented reality integration, improved connectivity, and voice assistance integration have been extensively developed this past decade and are now being implemented in projects like these. We are certainly in the midst of the most exciting tech era!
* What are the other major companies in this field?
#### Major competitors to the Meta AI Ray-Ban sunglasses are Bose Frames and Google Glass “smart glasses” which were launched in 2014 (Investopedia, 2023). Bose Frames provide glass frames with integrated audio capabilities, while Google Glass focuses on data interaction and augmented reality more than the fashion aspect of it all. In terms of the AI space in general, Meta’s competitors are Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and many other tech companies trying to spearhead the AI movement (Chat GPT).

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
#### Meta Platforms’ impact has been astounding through Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Now Meta AI reaching a combined 3.19 billion people worldwide and constantly innovating their platforms. However, the actual sunglass project (Ray-Ban Stories) has not had as positive an impact as anticipated by this wildly successful company. User retention and technical issues have led to lower-than-expected sales and a shocking 13% return rate (The Verge, 2023).
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
#### Meta had hoped to sell up to 478,000 units of the Ray-Ban Stories during the product’s lifetime. However, the company announced that only 27,000 of the 300,000 units sold between September 2021 and February 2023 are still being used. This means around 90% of consumers have abandoned the product, which is terrible news for Meta. The company lost $8 million in the first half of 2023 and expects further losses throughout 2024 (The Verge, 2023). They also did not reach their overall sales goal of 478,000 units, making this first-generation release of the sunglasses unsuccessful in comparison to their targeted success metrics. However, there is excitement about the future product versions.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
#### Every player in this industry has struggled, some more than others. Google Glass “smart glasses” failed and were pulled off the market due to their high prices (retail for $1,500 compared to Meta’s $299 and Bose’s $200), as well as safety, and privacy concerns (Investopedia, 2023). On the other hand, Bose Frames have seen the most success due to their specific focus on audio capabilities. The Ray-Ban Stories by Meta AI have also struggled, as mentioned above. However, they are the most versatile product with the most appealing look, which gives the company hope for their second-generation launch.

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
#### The technical issues mentioned above relate to audio, voice commands, poor battery life, and difficulties importing media from other devices (The Verge, 2023). This has led to poor results for Meta. However, the company still plans to launch a second-generation version of the product, and this makes sense. With every new tech product there is customer resistance, but the world is trending towards innovation and products like these, which is why there will always be players in this space and consumers will eventually give in. That is why it makes sense for Meta to stick with it. In order to improve their product, I would advise Meta to first and foremost improve the current tech capabilities. They already had a trial run and now know how to improve the sunglasses’ AI audio, voice command, battery and data importing capabilities. Secondly, they need to make sure the customer knows their data will be protected and not be shared with any third parties. Topics such as AI Ethics must be seriously considered in order to deliver a user-friendly product that provides an ethically aware service that improves individual and communal well-being (Chat GPT). People like their privacy, so this topic must be considered in order for Meta to not struggle the way Google Glass did. Furthermore, Meta should target the augmented reality field and music capabilities to further improve their sunglasses and compete for Google’s and Bose’s markets down the line.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
#### Meta and Ray-Ban are already established giant companies that generate enough revenue to explore avenues and fund projects. Their partnership already gives Meta an edge in the luxury and brand loyal space when competing against other sunglass brands. Now, improving and implementing even more technology would help these sunglasses become the only choice for customers. It would also cement Meta Platforms as an undoubted AI leader, not only in the machine interaction space, but in the wearable technology field. If the project’s technology and future generation products are successful, the opportunities for profit are unmeasurable.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
#### The technology needed to implement these changes would obviously be extensive. Apart from integrating voice, audio, camera and smart assistance capabilities, Meta AI would have to also implement music/speakers and augmented reality capabilities, which is no easy task. However, these technologies would cover a wide spectrum of competencies that the sunglasses could successfully perform, which would attract all types of consumers (luxury product lovers, tech savvy young generations, researchers, etc.) It would be the biggest leap done towards creating real life Tony Starks, and Meta Platforms would be at the front of it. How exciting!
